About
=====

The ``nifpga`` package contains an API for interacting with National Instrument's
LabVIEW FPGA Devices - from Python. This package was created and is officially
supported by National Instruments.

**nifpga**  supports versions 16.0 and later of the RIO driver.

Some functions in the **nifpga** package may be unavailable with earlier
versions of your RIO driver. Visit the
`National Instruments downloads page <http://www.ni.com/downloads/>`_ to
upgrade the appropriate RIO device driver for your hardware.

**nifpga** supports Windows and Linux operating systems.

**nifpga** supports Python  2.7, 3.4+ . **nifpga** will likely work on other Python implementations.  Feel free to open a issue on github for supporting a new implementation.
